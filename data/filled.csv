Five minutes later, just before midnight, the same group attacked a 47 year old man on Brocks Park East, stealing his backpack.

4,But even though the state never ordered rolling,feel since their power got cut out needlessly.,16859,"But even though the state never ordered rolling blackouts, some bay area neighborhoods did see their power cut. Hillsborough, Alameda and Palo Alto all shut off power to some customers. Kpxy. Sarah Dante is live in Alameda. Explain why officials in those cities say it's not their fault. A lot of finger pointing happening here today. Ryan with this story. So again, those rolling blackouts that happened, it turns out all of those were a mistake. A very costly, in some cases uncomfortable mistake. And we spent much of the day trying to figure out exactly what went wrong. Running a restaurant in the dark isn't just difficult, it's impossible. Just ask Stephanie. We can't take any card we don't have ride inside. So it's all dot her Alameda restaurant had the power cut off during its typically busy dinner hour, forcing them to close early. Customers were told it was part of a rolling blackout, but now it appears that was a mistake. Crazy. And we lost some more money. Yeah, that's it. Alameda along with yieldsburg and Palo Alto began rolling blackouts during Tuesday's statewide power crunch, leaving thousands without power during blazing heat. But Calyzo now says that was a miscommunication and that they simply asked utilities to be prepared. A direct request was for arming a firm load. As we conveyed to all the other utilities in California at that time, we had not progressed to rotating outages. And so I don't know, honestly, this morning exactly what happened there, but we will be in touch and certainly we're going to be doubling down our communication. Alameda Municipal Power says the Northern California Power Agency, a nonprofit that oversees several Northern California utilities, told it to begin load shedding operations. Experts say this is how the process normally goes. The grid operator makes the determination that it really doesn't want to make, that rolling blackouts needs to be called for. But the grid operator doesn't actually implement those blackouts. They have to talk to the utilities and ask them to put the blackouts in place. But Cal ISO points to a mix up between its dispatchers and those from the Northern California Power Agency that apparently led to some mixed messaging and the power unnecessarily being shut off for thousands. These are situations that obviously happen very infrequently, and there was a lot happening on the grid for everybody last night. And so we'll double down on the communication, make sure that doesn't happen again. So we just heard back from Northern California Power Agency who sent a very long statement and essentially said that, yes, their dispatcher misunderstood, gave the wrong orders, and that's what led to these blackouts. They also, interestingly enough, took time to give themselves something of a pat on the back, saying because they did this while it was an accident, it may have inadvertently helped the state manage their load. Of course, I'm not sure how the thousands of people here would feel since their power got cut out needlessly.",100910,101238,"['0d817400-3f5d-41e0-929c-c31fdbe75d31', '6fbf954a-03f9-4782-a65f-783271c9c447', '74e2fab8-689f-4e17-9a1c-e1f92e084f55', '96326734-fd82-4350-b45c-513e7eb9147c', 'b49207eb-96eb-4b73-b534-adc0ef85022a']"

7,and the warriors are playing the Boston Celtics,that. We'll see if they get it tonight.,12387,"and the warriors are playing the Boston Celtics in game five of the NBA Finals. And the winner of tonight's game will be one win away from a Championship. And with tip off now less than an hour away, it's time to begin our team coverage. Ktv is Amber Lee with fans at Thrive City. But first, let's go courtside inside Chase Center with our Joe Fonzie. Joe, how's it going? Hi, Julie. What you said is pretty simple. It's now down to three games, and whoever wins two of those three is the NBA champion. If the warriors can win it, that would be four Championships in eight years. And that's the type of stuff that you talk about when you say dynasties, especially given the fact that they missed two years of playoffs. And one of the major reasons that they were not in the playoffs for two years was what happened to Clay Thompson. He was injured in that Toronto Raptors series that the Raptors won in six games, the fifth consecutive trip to the Finals for the warriors and then two years of rehab for Clay. So we've been talking about that anniversary. It was three years ago, but another anniversary. It's very interesting that was brought up tonight. It was 25 years ago that the Warrior coach, Steve Kerr hit a shot that gave the Chicago Bulls a win over the Utah Jazz with 5 seconds left. That was the fifth of the Bulls six Championships. They did that in eight years. So another dynasty. And obviously when guys are around each other as much as they are in a series like that, topics come up like that. And Kerr was asked tonight to reflect on that moment in his career. The finals or the Finals, whether you're playing or you're coaching, it's the ultimate competition in the world of basketball. So there's a lot of nerves and a lot of excitement and a lot of stress and all that stuff. And I think my experience as a player has definitely helped me prepare to coach a team in the finals because I know what these guys are feeling. And you can see that we're counting down to tip off right now that's Clay Thompson out there going through his pregame routine. And I know that he's hoping that he doesn't have too many of those clients like that if he was trying for a three pointer there in his warmups. But as I said, guys, it's very simple now. It's just whoever wins two games and you have three opportunities to do that. The other thing that has been kind of a characteristic of this series, neither team has taken full advantage of home court advantage. They've split the two games here. They split the two games in Boston. It's home court advantage now to the warriors again. They've regained that. They take care of business at home. They're Champions. So that's where we stand right now. Both teams want to try to make a big step and win that third game with an eventual four necessary to be a champion guy. Yeah. And Joe, we were talking a little bit about this last night at Draymond Green, Steph Curry, Clay Thompson. They haven't really seemed to be quite in sync like they have been in previous series. Do you think we might see them come out altogether tonight? And if so, they're going to be a tough match up against the Celtics. Yes, no question about that. Julie, I was in Boston for games three and four and obviously like to listen to what the talk radio is saying in the hometown there. And they were saying we saw what Steph Curry did in game four. He had 43 points. Draymond has not had his best games. Clay had 18 in that game and had that big shot that gave them the lead. But I think you could say we have not seen vintage Clay Thompson or Drama Green yet in this series. And what the people in Boston fear, they know what Curry is if they get vintage of those other two guys, not to mention what Andrew Wiggins and Jordan Poole and Kevin Looney bring to the picture, they're afraid of the warriors, but so far, the warriors haven't gotten that. We'll see if they get it tonight.",419994,420182,"['0d817400-3f5d-41e0-929c-c31fdbe75d31', '39822b5f-e37e-43e8-b997-7142fe55c3ea', '6fbf954a-03f9-4782-a65f-783271c9c447', '74e2fab8-689f-4e17-9a1c-e1f92e084f55', '83a09c6b-5f2f-421f-ae50-b38acca7e008', '96326734-fd82-4350-b45c-513e7eb9147c', 'ca197b81-ca86-4792-8c25-2ba7cd4195b5', 'e7cbe38d-c987-4113-aa94-fd77eda451d5', 'f5cdd7f2-9d4d-4ba5-9925-00c1701e30fa']"

A life taken too soon. Last Thursday, around 220 in the afternoon, EMT Lieutenant Alison Russo stepped outside of her station house in Queens near 20th Avenue and 44th street, according to authorities. That's when 34 year old Peter Zasapolis allegedly went on a vicious, unprovoked attack, stabbing Russo two dozen times. Police say Zosopolis was then chased by witnesses into his apartment, where he barricaded himself. Eventually, he was taken into custody and charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Members of the FDNY are mourning the loss of their comrade, who loved helping people. She was also a volunteer for her local ambulance corps. Her friends and fellow first responders remember Russo as a woman who loved her job in serving others. It really has sent shockwaves through our entire organization. Really a spitfire. She has a great personality. Just like lit up a room when she came in. It's overwhelming. I'm still in shock. Lieutenant Russo is the 1158 member of the FDNY to die in the line of duty and the second member of EMS to die in the line of duty in the last five years.

14,detectives are searching for six people they say,with any information is asked to call police.,18246,"detectives are searching for six people they say may have witnessed the horrific murder of a 22 year old Brooklyn woman. Judy Deja Johnson's remains were found inside two suitcases in her home last month. Let's check in with Pixel Evans, Karen Dylan, who's joining us live outside police headquarters with the very latest this morning. Karen? Hi. Good morning. Craig and Hazel was just a horribly, horribly sad story out of Brooklyn. Really tragic for Deja Johnson's family and friends. Now we know that her body was found inside of two suitcases inside of her own apartment in Cypress Hills nearly two weeks ago. And now police are asking for your help and figuring out what happened to her. Take a look at these images. On Sunday, detectives released these pictures of five women and one man who police believe may have been witnesses to the crime. Johnson's remains were found inside two suitcases on September 21 by officers who were performing a wellness check in her apartment. The building super had noticed a foul odor and let people in to check on the woman. Now, early on, police sources and neighbors told Pixel Eleven that investigators were looking for the victim's boyfriend and possibly an accomplice in connection to the case. Police have yet to confirm those details. Arguing, banging, lost off, regular stuff. But like I said, if you try to interrupt or something like that, you're just putting yourself in a problem you can't solve. Somebody gets hit very hard in the mouth, right, the bloodshed will lead from the door to the elevator. So right now, official cause of death has yet to be released. We are still waiting for an update from the medical examiner's office. Meantime, if you would like to look at those images of these potential witnesses one more time, you can head to our website, pixelven.com. Once again, anyone with any information is asked to call police.",350830,351498,"['0d817400-3f5d-41e0-929c-c31fdbe75d31', '39822b5f-e37e-43e8-b997-7142fe55c3ea', '6fbf954a-03f9-4782-a65f-783271c9c447', '74e2fab8-689f-4e17-9a1c-e1f92e084f55', '96326734-fd82-4350-b45c-513e7eb9147c', 'b49207eb-96eb-4b73-b534-adc0ef85022a', 'ca197b81-ca86-4792-8c25-2ba7cd4195b5', 'e7cbe38d-c987-4113-aa94-fd77eda451d5']"
15,San Jose police say a security guard trying,not released yet by the Santa Clara County,12387,"San Jose police say a security guard trying to protect a woman during a domestic dispute was shot and killed during a triple shooting. It happened at a sprawling apartment complex in the 300 block of Crescent Village Circle in North San Jose, not far from Zanker Road and East Tasman Drive. Ktv is Jesse Gary live now in North San Jose with new information on the case. Jesse. Julie, good evening to you. Residents here say the most they've had to deal with car break inside, not even on their radar. Investigators say the incident with the married couple took place in the parking lot behind me. Ultimately, witnesses tell me the security guard died trying to do the right thing. It's really sad and scary that people have access to guns so easily that a domestic dispute could lead to loss of life so quickly. Resident Vishnu Mihala lives one floor above the murder scene at the Crescent Village apartment complex in North San Jose. He says his wife heard gunshots early Sunday morning and he awoke to hear the final shot Monday. San Jose police investigator saying a domestic dispute between a husband and wife turned deadly when an apartment security guard intervened. I'm sure he's trying to do the right thing right. See somebody in distress and wants to go help and intervene. And unfortunately, the suspect committed a very heinous act and killed him. Detectives say after the suspect killed a security guard, he shot and killed his wife and then took his own life. The triple loss of life taking place in an exterior parking lot of the Tony apartment complex is unnerving for some neighbors. I was pretty afraid. Honestly, it's kind of shaking. Seems like a very random act, and that's not something you want to see anyway. But feel for the victims, of course. One resident says the murdered guard patrol the complex parallel to Zanker Road and Bellagio Street. He was a very nice guy and he used to basically be responsible to make sure nobody got through this door. Like if he saw somebody trying to stay here for too long and not able to get in, he would come and say, what's going on? Who are you? Monday apartment complex general manager Kim Robinson emailed a statement to Fox Two which says our entire team is deeply saddened by the lives that were lost in this tragic incident. And our thoughts are with their families. We are offering counseling to our employees during this difficult time. Investigators say the couple had six children, ages twelve months to ten years. The kids are staying with their maternal grandmother as detectives try to unravel how our marital dispute led to three deaths. Looking down from there every day now, we don't know. Even after a week or ten days or a month, we'll ever be like, look at it in a normal way. Detectives are gathering video surveillance evidence as well as witness statements to try to determine what led up to the initial conflict, which drew the guard to the parking lot.
